I am a platform engineer with a bachelor and a master degree in computer science - focused on artificial intelligence. I'm a **AWS Certified Developer**, **AWS Certified Solution Architect** and AWS **Certified Machine Learning Specialist**. I love **Golang**, **Docker**, serverless architecture and **quantum computing**/mechanics. In my free time, I'm a software developer - you can find me on Github at [@made2591](https://github.com/made2591/), a blogger, a juggler, a skier, a skater, a guitarist (sometimes) and a dreamer (always). I'm always looking for something to learn, for a team of passionate people to work with, a mentor to guide us, in a company that wants to make the difference.

### My results

I graduated with honors and distinction with a thesis in the field of **neuro-computational model**, and specifically about taxonomic response and fast-mapping abilities of children, entitled [A Visual Auditory Model based on Growing Self-organizing Maps to analyze the Taxonomic Response in early childhood](https://made2591.github.com/matteo_madeddu_master_thesis.pdf). For this work, I was invited at the [__AI*IA__](http://www.aixia.it/) conference, held in Genova from Nov 28th to Dec 1st 2016 to receive a special mention as one of the Best Italian Master thesis in Artificial Intelligence ðŸ˜Ž.

### What happened to me recently

My master thesis was published in the Journal of Cognitive System Research [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389041717303558) - and moved to [adidas HQ](http://herzo.adidas-group.com/) joining the Platform Engineering & Architecture Team as a Platform Engineer. I became **AWS Certified Developer**, **AWS Certified Solution Architect** and AWS **Certified Machine Learning Specialist**:

### Proud of

From time to time, I like studying reading about quantum world and a few time ago I started to collect some [quantum-notes](https://github.com/made2591/quantum-notes): in this document I write my personal notes about IBM Q platform, but most of all the quantum-computing world in general. I was also invited in Verona by the Quantum Research Group to talk about the platform. A pre-compiled (not super updated) version is available [here](https://madeddu.xyz/matteo_madeddu_quantum_notes.pdf)! Enjoy the reading!
