### Prelude
Nobody ever tells you enough: you need to know the _fundamentals_. Ok - what am I talking about? I would rather limit myself to talking about computer science, something I really do not know about. 

### Intro
As this blog says, I'm an IT guy, and I reiterate that...I do not know anything about computer science. It is of course a fault of mine, at least in part, but I think it is also due to the time we live, the opportunities that surround me, the needs of the market, an endless amount of statistics about the world, the number people who live, the kind of people who are gone, the people who govern, the people who don't, the available types of work, the new laws, the old laws, the borders, netflix-facebook-twitter-snapchat-telegram-instagram-pinterest-reddit-batman, certainly also because of Tweedledum and Tweedledee, and so many others things. 
I think I will go through some of the reasons that I feel are the most important ones to explain my disappointed about my lack of knowledge.

### Time
Let's start with this assumption: computer science - I mean, a simple f\*\*\*ng consumer pc with text editor and stop, available for people and not _nerds in a garage_ - was born after the birth of my parents. There where no internet for them, no wikipedia, no \*chat\* at all - because they hadn't cell phone or smartphone in their teenage years - foundamentally, none of what is almost necessarily part of our lives today. I often find myself asking "what the hell! how did you survive?!?" mostly because today I can't live without all of this stuff, and I would be cut out of any set I belong to - besides the fact that I would be without a job.
I think that the answer lies in the same _time_ they lived: fourty years ago there wasn't almost anything in my field - and in so many others because (again) I'm in IT - and people was pushed to study, work, approach themselves, engineer themselves, invent themselves, sell themselves in a totally different way from what happens today. Some time ago a guy told me this story: he studied Computer Science at University and he followed a class called _Operating Systems_. The final project was _writing an operating system_[^os]. So it was in many other fields: the final project for obtaining a diploma as an _electronic expert_ was _building a radio_ or _a set of strobe lights_, in both case starting from nothing or just a book and some savings to buy components. Only God knows what was required to obtain a specialization in Medicine and Surgery[^med]. They tried, even without hope, because they had no alternative. They succeeded - mi piace credere - because they were forced to deal with the fundamentals in their respective fields of study. 
The point is _(almost) all the (smart) people of the previous generation, with respect to mine generation, are able to do things by themself_, without delegate goals to others and I am upset about this, I really envy them, not so much because they didn't have all the comforts and tools I studied / grow up / played with, but most because they had no choice! I truly think this helped them a lot. Fourty here ago, the definition of expert coincided in many fields with those who had access to a large amount of information. Today it isn't so anymore: today, an expert is someone who can filter the informations, which are redundant and often wrong. If you're one of the new ones, there's no more time to insist on fundamentals: they are literally buried under layers of complex research, evolutions, tools, opinions, articles and books. Before today, it was necessary to know the fundamentals, because they were required: the world as I know it today was built by those who used the same basic knowledge I tried to decribe to learn and invent new things.
Nobody ever tells you enough: you need to know the _fundamentals_.

### Place
In my opinion, the biggest problem in the lack of knowledge (mainly, of fundamentals) today is that seems no importance is given to this key aspect of knowledge. The world is ultra-professional: if I look for someone who knows and is able to use a technology, it seems almost obvious that he has fundamentals in its cultural background. Nothing more wrong, I say. Ok, I am from Italy, so let's talk a little _bad_ about Italy because it's a very Italian move, and I am proud to be Italian (even if I am more IT[and stop] than a complete _ITalian guy_). In the last years, I've done many interviews for positions abroad and I'm sorry to notice it just now:

### Media

Thank you everybody for reading!

[^os]: For those who are from IT, this is a big hard task. 
[^med]: Ok, calm down doctors! I am sure it is not so easy also today XD!
