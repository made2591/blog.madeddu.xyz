### A beautiful childhood
I've never been a fan of videogames, neither as a child nor today: do not get me wrong, as many guys of my generation I also owned and played with the legendary __PlayStation 1__ (1995)[^p1] and __PlayStation 2__[^p2] by Sony and the __Nintendo Game Boy__[^gb]. It was fun, but not so much as playing to videogames born a few years before I was born. 
In the 80s, there were not yet the powerful graphics chips that today can be found with a few hundred euros. How did the videogames work? It's simple: without graphics. There were many _textual games_ and in my opinion, for many vintage lovers, they would still be cool today. My generation has lost this advantage of literaly _building with fantasy the world around a game_. So, some days ago I found my self thinking back to Sheldoon Cooper that plays with the game Dungeon in the Big Bang Theory[^bbt], or to the kids of _Stranger Things_ by Netflix, or to my father, to whom I gave an original _Playstation 1_ with the first TombRaider(s), and I asked myself _how it would be possible today to play again one of those text games_ that were so popular in that decade...to the point of deciding to create one of my own.

In this article I will talk about how to create a vintage 80s game! If you want to download the first version of Horizon right away, [here]() is the source code. If you want to find out how to build a game of the 80s - simply using Python[^ff] - read on!

### Recipe for a good game
Building a videogame, textual or not, is not the typical task for a computer scientists. Then, regardless of what your goal is and the complexity of the game you have in mind to create, you must first have a clear idea of how you want your video game to work. In my honest opinion, a textual game must be as adventurous as possible, with all the characteristics of a classic rpg moderno: a single player, items of different nature that affect the player and the environment in which he is immersed, player's life and/or statistics that interfere in performing certain actions, a simple and clear objective, even broken up into several simple tasks, one or more maps in which to hardly extricate themselves, possibly divided into levels too.
