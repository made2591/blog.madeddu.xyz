### A little tool for a small city
Here we are!! I recently moved to Germany to join the adidas - platform engineering team. [This](https://github.com/made2591/go-erlangen) is a really small piece of GOde (:P) I wrote for Erlangen (my new place) citizens ^^

#### Needs
You will only need an [https://www.internationalshowtimes.com/](https://www.internationalshowtimes.com/) movie api key. You can get one quite easily by going [here](https://www.internationalshowtimes.com/signup.html)

#### Scope
You would simply like to be informed about new OV movies on air in cinemas from your shell...here we go! The script in the repo provide you a draft to start from ^^

#### Improvements
Webinterface, scheduling, notification...enjoy the city - and the repo!

Thank you everybody for reading!
