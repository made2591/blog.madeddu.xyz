  I am a Computer Science enthusiast with a strong propensity to interdisciplinarity. 
  
  I obtained a bachelor and master degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. 

  I graduated with honors and distinction in April 2016 with a thesis in the field of neuro-computational model, and specifically about taxonomic response and fast-mapping abilities of children, entitled [A Visual Auditory Model based on Growing Self-organizing Maps to analyze the Taxonomic Response in early childhood](https://made2591.github.com/matteo_madeddu_master_thesis.pdf).
  
  I was invited at the [__AI*IA__](http://www.aixia.it/) conference, held in Genova from Nov 28th to Dec 1st 2016 to receive a special mention for my work, considered one of the Best Italian Master thesis in Artificial Intelligence.

  Tech skills: I have a deep knowledge of Python, Java, Javascript, PHP, MATLAB.

  Iâ€™m a dreamer, a juggler, a skater, a skier, a guitarist (sometimes).

  ## My opensource repo

  Currently working on

  - [go-perceptron-go](http://github.com/made2591/go-perceptron-go) - experiments with Go and really simple neural network models.
  - [quantum](http://github.com/made2591/quantum) - experiments with entagled state in OpenQASM 2.0.

  ## Some old opensource repo

  * [cognitive-system-postagger](https://github.com/made2591/cognitive-system-postagger) is a part-of-speech tagger (viterbi / cky) / probabilistic-context-free-grammar manipulator library written in Python.
  * [cognitive-system-semantics](https://github.com/made2591/cognitive-system-semantics) is a word sense disambiguation / document classification tool library written in Java using mainly Wordnet and Babelnet.
  * [__spotispy-framework__](https://made2591.github.com/spotispy-framework) is (will be) a docker-based (I'm planning porting with [@valentinarho](https://github.com/valentinarho)) Python framework to make data science - the musician way. 
  * [google-task-gtd](https://github.com/made2591/google-task-gtd) is a sort of involuntary google goals library written in Python - I swear, I wrote this 3/4 months before goals came out XD.
  * [__gym-workout__](https://github.com/made2591/gym-workout) is a vagrant machine (uuuu, vm, third millenium - I know, you dockerers) with a silex+propel+materialize web based application to manage gym workout.
  * [trello2google](https://github.com/made2591/trello2google) is a trello / google-calendar-task-management library written in Python with the BIG contribution of [@valentinarho](https://github.com/valentinarho).
  
  and so many [__many others__](https://github.com/made2591?tab=repositories) cutting-edge repo XD in my github.com page.
