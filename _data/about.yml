  I am Matteo, I have a bs and ms in computer science with a specialization in artificial intelligence.

  I graduated with honors and distinction in April 2016 with a thesis in the field of neuro-computational model, and specifically about taxonomic response and fast-mapping abilities of children, entitled [A Visual Auditory Model based on Growing Self-organizing Maps to analyze the Taxonomic Response in early childhood](https://made2591.github.com/matteo_madeddu_master_thesis.pdf). For this work, I was invited at the [__AI*IA__](http://www.aixia.it/) conference, held in Genova from Nov 28th to Dec 1st 2016 to receive a special mention as one of the Best Italian Master thesis in Artificial Intelligence ðŸ˜Ž.

  I am a Golang dev, Mac OS lover, Docker fan, Python geek, Trello addicted, a juggler, a skier, a skater, a guitarist (sometimes), a dreamer (always). Always looking for a team of passionate people to work with, a mentor to guide us, in a company that wants to make the difference.

  ## What happened to me recently

  My master thesis was published in the Journal of Cognitive System Research [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389041717303558) - and moved to adidas HQ joining the Platform Engineering & Architecture Team as a Platform Engineer.

  ## Some of my repo

  * [__go-perceptron-go__](http://github.com/made2591/go-perceptron-go) - experiments with Go and really simple neural network models.
  * [quantum](http://github.com/made2591/quantum) - experiments with entagled state in OpenQASM 2.0.
  * [predix-configurator](https://github.com/made2591/predix-configurator) is a configuration tool realized to help you setup your edge connectivity stack.
  * [cognitive-system-postagger](https://github.com/made2591/cognitive-system-postagger) is a part-of-speech tagger (viterbi / cky) / probabilistic-context-free-grammar manipulator library written in Python.
  * [cognitive-system-semantics](https://github.com/made2591/cognitive-system-semantics) is a word sense disambiguation / document classification tool library written in Java using mainly Wordnet and Babelnet.
  * [__spotispy-framework__](https://made2591.github.com/spotispy-framework) is (will be) a docker-based (I'm planning porting with [@valentinarho](https://github.com/valentinarho)) Python framework to make data science - the musician way.
  * [google-task-gtd](https://github.com/made2591/google-task-gtd) is a sort of involuntary google goals library written in Python - I swear, I wrote this 3/4 months before goals came out XD.
  * [__gym-workout__](https://github.com/made2591/gym-workout) is a vagrant machine (uuuu, vm, third millenium - I know, you dockerers) with a silex+propel+materialize web based application to manage gym workout.
  * [trello2google](https://github.com/made2591/trello2google) is a trello / google-calendar-task-management library written in Python with the BIG contribution of [@valentinarho](https://github.com/valentinarho).

  and [__some others__](https://github.com/made2591?tab=repositories).

  ## Some of my notes (attention: tex available!!ðŸ˜ƒ)

  * [quantum-notes](https://github.com/made2591/quantum-notes) - this is a latex document that collect my personal notes about IBM Q platform, in general the quantum-computing world. I was also invited in Verona by the Quantum Research Group to talk about the platform - why? don't know, maybe the coolest guys were sick ðŸ˜‚ A compiled version is available [here](https://madeddu.xyz/matteo_madeddu_quantum_notes.pdf)! Enjoy the reading!

  ## Actual work position (adidas HQ)
