  I am Matteo, I have a bs and ms in computer science with a specialization in artificial intelligence. 

  I graduated with honors and distinction in April 2016 with a thesis in the field of neuro-computational model, and specifically about taxonomic response and fast-mapping abilities of children, entitled [A Visual Auditory Model based on Growing Self-organizing Maps to analyze the Taxonomic Response in early childhood](https://made2591.github.com/matteo_madeddu_master_thesis.pdf). For this work, I was invited at the [__AI*IA__](http://www.aixia.it/) conference, held in Genova from Nov 28th to Dec 1st 2016 to receive a special mention as one of the Best Italian Master thesis in Artificial Intelligence.

  I am a Golang dev, Mac OS lover, Docker fan, Python geek, Trello addicted, a juggler, a skier, a skater, a guitarist (sometimes), a dreamer (always). Always looking for a team of passionate people to work with, a mentor to guide us, in a company that wants to make the difference.

  ## Some of my repo

  * [__go-perceptron-go__](http://github.com/made2591/go-perceptron-go) - experiments with Go and really simple neural network models.
  * [quantum](http://github.com/made2591/quantum) - experiments with entagled state in OpenQASM 2.0.
  * [predix-configurator](https://github.com/made2591/predix-configurator) is a configuration tool realized to help you setup your edge connectivity stack.

  * [google-task-gtd](https://github.com/made2591/google-task-gtd) is a sort of involuntary google goals library written in Python - I swear, I wrote this 3/4 months before goals came out XD.
  * [__gym-workout__](https://github.com/made2591/gym-workout) is a vagrant machine (uuuu, vm, third millenium - I know, you dockerers) with a silex+propel+materialize web based application to manage gym workout.
