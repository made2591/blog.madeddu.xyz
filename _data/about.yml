  I am Matteo, I'm a platform engineer and a software developer. I love golang, I am a macOS lover, docker fan, python geek, trello addicted, juggler, skier, skater, guitarist (sometimes) and dreamer (always). I'm always looking for a team of passionate people to work with, a mentor to guide us, in a company that wants to make the difference.

  ### My results

  I graduated with honors and distinction with a thesis in the field of neuro-computational model, and specifically about taxonomic response and fast-mapping abilities of children, entitled [A Visual Auditory Model based on Growing Self-organizing Maps to analyze the Taxonomic Response in early childhood](https://made2591.github.com/matteo_madeddu_master_thesis.pdf). For this work, I was invited at the [__AI*IA__](http://www.aixia.it/) conference, held in Genova from Nov 28th to Dec 1st 2016 to receive a special mention as one of the Best Italian Master thesis in Artificial Intelligence ðŸ˜Ž.

  ### What happened to me recently

  My master thesis was published in the Journal of Cognitive System Research [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389041717303558) - and moved to [adidas HQ](http://herzo.adidas-group.com/) joining the Platform Engineering & Architecture Team as a Platform Engineer.

  ### Proud of

  From time to time, I like studying reading about quantum world and a few time ago I started to collect some [quantum-notes](https://github.com/made2591/quantum-notes): in this document I write my personal notes about IBM Q platform, but most of all the quantum-computing world in general. I was also invited in Verona by the Quantum Research Group to talk about the platform. A pre-compiled (not super updated) version is available [here](https://madeddu.xyz/matteo_madeddu_quantum_notes.pdf)! Enjoy the reading!
